## Language Construction Tool

# Release Notes

Welcome to the Language Construction Tool (LCT)! As you will probably have guessed, this tool is designed to help you keep track of your work with languages. This could mean several things like:

- Designing/constructing a language (conlanging)
- Learning a language
- Keeping track of a professional Vocabulary (Terms)

Of course you can configure this tool to fit your needs however you like. For example, with some small adjustments you could use it as database-manager for receipies and so on.

# Prerequisites and Quickstart

This tools entire GUI is based on tkinter.
Everything is tested and developed on Python 3.8.
I highly recommend working with a virtual environment, especially due to the many dependencies.

You can check out the venv-module here.

Once you have setup the venv, just install the requirements.txt via pip.

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Now you should be good to go! With your venv enabled, run 

`python app.py`
