**Recent Plans**

- Make own class out of treeview sidebar, in its own frame
- Make edit word Button
- Implement a pos-chooser, like a spinbox or Combobox (test this)
- Make the search work
- Make Sorting work


**Undockable multiple Treeviews**

- Make a Button, so a user can make multiple, free floating
instances of the sidebar, to compare words and stuff
- in each of the sidebars he can search and choose pos
- Make a "Clone Floaty" Button

- For this to work, the functions display vocabulary and
display data has to be given as paramters in each instance,
so they can use it on their own
- especially so they can use the pos chooser and search bar


**Image Imports**

- User can place images in a folder called "related_images" next to the excel sheet
- The images have to be named numerical, fitting to the row in the excel sheet
- There have not to be images for all words, but words for all images
- Check this with import

**Check Integrity Class**
- On Startup, the integrity class checks all crucial modules
- Database Check: Is the start.db in place and right,
if not, build it new.


**Database builder**
- Make own Database builder script
- Makes the start.db at first start
